# Problem Description
Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

Example:
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6

The elevation map [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1] represents:
```
  _
_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
```
(Visualize bars of heights 0, 1, 0, 2, etc.)

# Solution Approach
The provided trap method attempts to solve the problem by converting it to an area calculation. It aims to find the total area under the "bounding" walls that would hold water, and then subtract the area occupied by the bars themselves.

### Intuition

The strategy employed here is to find the highest bar in the entire landscape. This highest bar acts as a central peak. Water can be trapped to the left of this peak, and to the right of this peak. The amount of water trapped is determined by the shorter of the two surrounding bars.
The code calculates a totalS (which seems to represent the total area covered by "water walls") and subtracts totalHeight (the area covered by the bars themselves).

### Algorithm Steps
1. Initialization and Finding the Highest Point:

- n: Length of the height array.
- heighestPoint: Index of the highest bar found so far, initialized to 0.
- heighestValue: Height of the highest bar found so far, initialized to height[0].
- totalHeight: Accumulates the sum of all bar heights. This represents the total "solid" area.
- The first loop iterates through the height array to:
    - Find the global maximum heighestValue and its heighestPoint (index).
    - Calculate totalHeight.

2. Calculating totalS (Area under Water Walls):

The core logic then branches into three scenarios based on the heighestPoint:

- Case 1: heighestPoint == 0 (Highest point is at the beginning)
  - This means the highest bar is the leftmost one. Water can only be trapped to its right.
  - The algorithm iterates from n - 1 down to 1.
  - nextValue tracks the maximum height encountered so far when scanning from right to left.
  - totalS accumulates nextValue at each step. If height[i-1] is greater than nextValue, nextValue is updated.
  - Finally, totalS adds heighestValue once more.

- Case 2: heighestPoint == n - 1 (Highest point is at the end)
  - This means the highest bar is the rightmost one. Water can only be trapped to its left.
  - The algorithm iterates from 0 up to n - 2.
  - nextValue tracks the maximum height encountered so far when scanning from left to right.
  - totalS accumulates nextValue at each step. If height[i+1] is greater than nextValue, nextValue is updated.
  - Finally, totalS adds heighestValue once more.

- Case 3: heighestPoint is in the middle (0 < heighestPoint < n - 1)
  - This is the most general case. Water can be trapped on both sides of the heighestPoint.
  - Left Side Traversal (from left to heighestPoint - 1):
    - nextValue is initialized to height[0].
    - Iterates from 0 up to heighestPoint - 1.
    - totalS accumulates nextValue (which is the effective "left wall" height encountered so far). If height[i+1] is greater than nextValue, nextValue is updated.

  - Right Side Traversal (from right to heighestPoint + 1):
    - nextValue is initialized to height[n - 1].
    - Iterates from n - 1 down to heighestPoint + 1.
    - totalS accumulates nextValue (which is the effective "right wall" height encountered so far). If height[i-1] is greater than nextValue, nextValue is updated.

 - Finally, totalS adds nextValue (from the right side traversal's final nextValue) again. This last totalS += nextValue; seems problematic and potentially incorrect as heighestValue itself is usually the dominant "wall" at the pivot, and the nextValue at the end of the right traversal might not be a general "wall" for the whole segment including the peak. The logic for adding the peak itself is also a bit convoluted across the cases.

- Calculate Total Water:
  - return totalS - totalHeight; The idea is that totalS represents the total area of the "container" formed by the walls, and totalHeight is the area taken by the bars. The difference should be the trapped water.

# Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity:

- First Pass (Finding highest and totalHeight): The loop iterates n times. This is O(n).
- Calculating totalS:
  - The left scan loop runs heighestPoint times.
  - The right scan loop runs (n - 1) - heighestPoint times.
  - In the worst case (e.g., heighestPoint is near n/2), these two loops together cover almost all n elements.
  - Therefore, this section is O(n).

- Overall Time Complexity: O(n). The solution makes a constant number of passes over the array.

### Space Complexity:

- The solution uses a few constant extra variables (n, heighestPoint, heighestValue, nextValue, totalS, totalWater, totalHeight). No additional data structures whose size scales with n are used.
- Overall Space Complexity: O(1).
